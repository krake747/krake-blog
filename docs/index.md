# Welcome

Hey there! I am Kevin from Luxembourg.

I studied banking and finance in Innsbruck, Austria, where I discovered my passion for programming.
When I returned back home I started out as a financial risk analyst for risk and asset managers.
Now, after a few years I have fully transitioned into a full stack developer.

My current focus for backend solutions is the .NET ecosystem and for the frontend I use Angular.  

In addition, I am a hobby cyclist who at the current moment prefers to go on gravel rides.

The current bike collection:

- Trek Top Fuel SL 9.8 Project One (2017)
- Trek Powerfly 7 (2022)
- Trek Checkpoint SLR 6 Project One (2024)

Still missing a road bike to complete the collection though.

# **III.** Unveiling the Kitchen Module: Recipes and Prices in Our Food Truck Simulation

Welcome back to our food truck simulation series! In this post, weâ€™ll explore the `Kitchen` module, a crucial component of our food truck management system. This module is responsible for defining burger recipes, setting prices, and managing burger preparation messages.

## The Role of the Kitchen Module

The `Kitchen` module serves as the heart of our culinary operations, handling everything from burger recipes to preparation messages. It ensures that each burger is crafted according to specific guidelines and provides essential details about pricing and preparation.

You will find the complete source code of the `Kitchen` module in the [Appendix](#appendix).

### **Defining Burger Types and Ingredients**

At the core of the `Kitchen` module are the definitions for various burger types and their ingredients. We categorize burgers into different types, each with a unique set of ingredients:

```fsharp
type BurgerType =
    | CrispyFried
    | SmokeyGrilled
    | JuicyPulled
```

We also define the ingredients used in our burgers, including toppings, sauces, and bun types:

```fsharp
type Topping =
    | Cheese
    | Lettuce
    | Tomato
    | Onion
    | Pickles

type Sauce =
    | BBQ
    | Chipotle
    | HoneyMustard
    | Cocktail

type BunType =
    | Potato
    | Sesame
    | Brioche
```

### **Assembling a Burger**

The `assembleBurger` function combines these ingredients into a complete burger object. It uses the burger type to determine the specific ingredients and price:

```fsharp
let assembleBurger burgerType =
    let ingredients = burgerIngredients burgerType

    {
        Type = burgerType
        Price = Menu.getPrice burgerType |> Option.defaultValue 0.0m
        Ingredients = ingredients
    }
```

Here, `burgerIngredients` fetches the detailed recipe for each burger type, while `Menu.getPrice` retrieves the price from the `Menu` submodule.

### **Preparing Burgers**

The `prepareBurger` function provides a description of the preparation process based on the burger type. This message helps simulate the cooking process and gives a realistic touch to our food truck simulation:

```fsharp
let prepareBurger burgerType =
    Menu.getPreparationMessage burgerType
```

### **The Menu Submodule**

To keep our `Kitchen` module organized, we've incorporated a `Menu` submodule. This submodule handles pricing and preparation messages for different burger types. Here's how it works:

#### **Burger Prices**

The `Menu` submodule maintains a map of burger prices:

```fsharp
let private burgerPrices =
    Map.ofList [
        (CrispyFried, 5.0m)
        (SmokeyGrilled, 6.0m)
        (JuicyPulled, 7.0m)
    ]

let getPrice burgerType =
    burgerPrices |> Map.tryFind burgerType
```

#### **Preparation Messages**

It also provides preparation messages for each burger type:

```fsharp
let private burgerPreparationMessages =
    Map.ofList [
        (CrispyFried, "Preparing a crispy fried burger with a brioche bun")
        (SmokeyGrilled, "Preparing a smokey grilled burger with a sesame bun")
        (JuicyPulled, "Preparing a juicy pulled burger with a potato bun")
    ]

let getPreparationMessage burgerType =
    burgerPreparationMessages
    |> Map.tryFind burgerType
    |> Option.defaultValue "Unknown burger type"
```

### **Understanding the Option Type**

In F#, the `Option` type is a way to explicitly model the presence or absence of a value. It is used to represent computations that might fail or data that might be missing, avoiding the pitfalls of null values, like `NullReferenceException` in C\# or SQL's three-valued logic. 

The `Option` type forces us to handle the "missing value" case explicitly, rather than relying on null checks ensuring our code gracefully handles scenarios where data might not be available.

#### **How is the Option Type represented in F\#?**

The `Option` type can be one of two cases:

- `Some(value)`: Indicates that a value is present.
- `None`: Indicates that no value is present.

For example:

```fsharp
let getPrice burgerType =
    burgerPrices |> Map.tryFind burgerType
```

In this function, `Map.tryFind` returns an `Option` type. If the `burgerType` is found in the `burgerPrices` map, it returns `Some(price)`. If it's not found, it returns `None`.

#### **Using Option**

To work with `Option` types, you often use functions like `Option.defaultValue` to provide a fallback value in case of `None`. For instance:

```fsharp
let assembleBurger burgerType =
    let ingredients = burgerIngredients burgerType

    {
        Type = burgerType
        Price = Menu.getPrice burgerType |> Option.defaultValue 0.0m
        Ingredients = ingredients
    }
```

In this example, if `Menu.getPrice burgerType` returns `None` (i.e., the burger type is not found), `Option.defaultValue 0.0m` ensures that `0.0m` is used as the default price.

### **Conclusion**

The `Kitchen` module is a vital part of our food truck simulation, encapsulating burger recipes, prices, and preparation messages. Understanding the `Option` type in F# helps in managing cases where values might be absent, ensuring that our code remains robust and reliable.

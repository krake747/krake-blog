# AOC 2024, Day 01: Tackling Historian Hysteria

[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is here, and as always on [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1), it starts with a simpler challenge: **Historian Hysteria**. In this post, we will primarily provide solutions in both C# and F#, showcasing the beauty of solving problems in multiple languages.

## Problem Breakdown

In Day 1 of Advent of Code 2024, we are given two lists of location IDs. The goal is to:

1. Find the total distance between the two lists after sorting and comparing corresponding pairs.
2. Calculate a similarity score based on how often each number in the first list appears in the second.

### **Part 1**: Distance Between Sorted Lists

To solve Part 1, we need to:

- Sort both lists.
- Compare each corresponding pair of numbers.
- Sum the absolute differences between the pairs.

### **Part 2**: Calculating the Similarity Score

For Part 2, we calculate a similarity score by:

- Adding up each number from the left list.
- Multiplying each number by how many times it appears in the right list.

## Solutions

=== "C#"

    ```csharp
    using AdventOfCode.Lib;

    namespace AdventOfCode.Y2024;

    [AocPuzzle(2024, 1, "Historian Hysteria", "C#")]
    public sealed class Day01 : IAocDay<int>
    {
        public static int Part1(AocInput input) => input.AllLines
            .Pipe(lines =>
            {
                var left = Instructions(lines, 0);
                var right = Instructions(lines, 1);
                return left.Zip(right, (l, r) => Math.Abs(l - r)).Sum();
            });

        public static int Part2(AocInput input) => input.AllLines
            .Pipe(lines =>
            {
                var left = Instructions(lines, 0);
                var counts = Instructions(lines, 1).CountBy(i => i).ToDictionary();
                return left.Sum(id => counts.GetValueOrDefault(id) * id);
            });
        
        private static IEnumerable<int> Instructions(IEnumerable<string> lines, int col) =>
            from line in lines
            let nums = line.Split("   ").Select(int.Parse).ToArray()
            orderby nums[col]
            select nums[col];
    }
    ```

=== "F#"

    ```fsharp
    open AdventOfCode.Lib

    module Fay01 =

        let instructions (lines: string seq) (col: int) =
            lines
            |> Seq.map (fun line -> line.Split("   ") |> Array.map int)
            |> Seq.sortBy (fun nums -> nums[col])
            |> Seq.map (fun nums -> nums[col])

        let part1 (input: AocInput) =
            let column = instructions input.Lines
            let left = column 0
            let right = column 1

            Seq.zip left right |> Seq.map (fun x -> abs (fst x - snd x)) |> Seq.sum

        let part2 (input: AocInput) =
            let column = instructions input.Lines
            let left = column 0
            let counts = column 1 |> Seq.countBy id |> Map.ofSeq

            let getCount id =
                Map.tryFind id counts |> Option.defaultValue 0

            left |> Seq.sumBy (fun id -> getCount id * id)
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```py
    from collections import Counter

    def instructions(lines: list[str], col: int) -> list[int]:
        return sorted(int(line.split("   ")[col]) for line in lines)


    def part1(input: AocInput) -> int:
        return sum(abs(l - r) for l, r in zip(instructions(input.lines, 0), instructions(input.lines, 1)))


    def part2(input: AocInput) -> int:
        left = instructions(input.lines, 0)
        counts = Counter(instructions(input.lines, 1))
        return sum([counts[id] * id for id in left])
    ```

## Conclusion 

Day 1 of Advent of Code 2024 introduced an interesting puzzle, involving sorting and comparing lists of historical location IDs.

# **II.** Building Blocks of the Food Truck Simulation: DDD Concepts with F\#

Welcome back to the food truck simulation series! In this post, we'll delve into Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts and explore how to implement these ideas using F#. We'll cover core concepts such as entities, value objects, aggregates, and services, and we'll introduce repositories using basic F# data structures like lists.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and F# Integration

Domain-Driven Design focuses on modeling complex business domains by breaking them into more manageable parts. F#'s functional programming features make it an excellent choice for implementing DDD principles. Scott Wlaschin, in his book “Domain Modeling Made Functional”, explores how functional programming, and specifically F#, aligns well with DDD concepts. His insights provide a solid foundation for understanding how functional programming can effectively model complex domains.

In this post, we'll see how these DDD concepts align with F# constructs:

### 1. **Domain**

The domain represents the area of expertise or activity the software is designed to handle. In our food truck simulation, this domain includes everything related to running a food truck, such as managing orders, inventory, and staff.

### 2. **Entities**

Entities are objects with a distinct identity and lifecycle. In our case, an `Order` is a key entity. We'll define `Order` as a record type in F#:

```fsharp
type Order = { 
    OrderId: int
    Burgers: Burger list
    TotalPrice: decimal
}
```

Here:

- `OrderId` is the unique identifier for the order.
- `Burgers` is a list of `Burger` entities included in the order.
- `TotalPrice` is the computed total price of the order.

### 3. **Value Objects**

Value objects are defined by their attributes rather than an identity. They are immutable and provide descriptive aspects of the domain. For example, `BurgerSize` can be represented as a discriminated union:

```fsharp
type BurgerSize =
    | Small
    | Medium
    | Large
```

This type helps us manage different burger sizes in our simulation.

### 4. **Aggregates**

Aggregates are clusters of related entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit. For our simulation, an `Order` can be an aggregate that includes multiple `Burger` entities. Here's how we might define a `Burger` record:

```fsharp
type Burger = { 
    Name: string
    Size: BurgerSize
    Price: decimal
}
```

In this definition:

- `Name` is the name of the burger.
- `Size` is a `BurgerSize` value object.
- `Price` is the cost of the burger.

### 5. **Services**

Services are components that encapsulate domain logic which doesn't fit neatly within entities or value objects. They perform operations or computations and often interact with multiple entities. For example, we might have a service to calculate the total price of an order:

```fsharp
module OrderService =

    let calculateOrderTotal (order: Order) =
        order.Burgers
        |> List.sumBy (fun burger -> burger.Price)
        |> fun total -> total - (total * 0.1m)  // Applying a 10% discount as an example
```

In this service:

- `calculateOrderTotal` computes the total price by summing up the prices of all burgers in the order and applying a discount.

### 6. **Repositories**

Repositories are responsible for managing access to aggregates and persisting them. In our simulation, we'll use a simple list to store and manage orders. Here's a basic implementation of a repository for `Order` entities:

```fsharp
module OrderRepository =

    type OrderStore = {
        Orders: Order list
    }

    let createStore () = {
        Orders = []
    }

    let addOrder (store: OrderStore) (order: Order) = {
        store with Orders = order :: store.Orders
    }

    let getOrderById (store: OrderStore) id =
        store.Orders |> List.tryFind (fun o -> o.OrderId = id)
```

In this example:

- `OrderStore` is a record type that holds a list of `Order` entities.
- `createStore` initializes a new `OrderStore` with an empty list of orders.
- `addOrder` returns a new `OrderStore` with the given order added to the list.
- `getOrderById` retrieves an order by its ID from the list of orders in the `OrderStore`.

## What's Next?

In the next post, we'll continue refining our food truck simulation by integrating more detailed functionalities and expanding our domain model. We'll explore how to handle more complex scenarios and interactions.

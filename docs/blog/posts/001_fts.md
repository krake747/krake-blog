# **I.** Introduction to the Food Truck Simulation Series

Welcome to the first post in my new blog series! Today, we will try simulating the operations of a food truck using F#. Imagine you're running a food truck famous for its mouth-watering fried chicken burgers. Our mission is to build a simulation that helps manage and streamline the day-to-day operations of your food truck. Let's dive in!

## What's This Series About?

My inspiration for this project comes from a Greek food truck that served the most incredible, loaded gyros I've ever tasted. I found myself going there almost every week, and I admired the owner's dedication to pursuing her culinary dreams.

The food was so fantastic that it sparked my curiosity about what goes on behind the scenes in running a food truck. I wondered how to effectively manage everything from inventory and staff scheduling to customer interactions. That curiosity led me to start this projectâ€”creating a simulation to model and optimize the daily operations of a food truck.

### Why F#?

F# might be new to some of you, so let's talk about why it's a great fit for our project:

- **Concise and Readable Code:** F# allows us to write clean and compact code. This means fewer bugs and easier maintenance.
- **Immutability by Default:** In F#, once you create a value, it doesn't change. This makes the simulation more predictable and less error-prone.
- **Strong Type System:** F#'s type system helps us model complex data accurately and safely.

### Why Not C#?

I've started programming with Python when I was a finance student, then transitioned to .NET and C# during my time as a risk analyst. While C# has been a fantastic tool, I wanted to explore F# to experience its functional programming style. F# is part of the .NET ecosystem and supports interoperability with C#, making it a great way to expand my skill set.

## Understanding F# Basics

Before we dive into the coding, let's cover some F# basics that will be useful for our project:

### 1. **Basic Syntax**

F# has a clean and straightforward syntax. For instance, here's a function that calculates the total price of a burger, including extra toppings:

```fsharp
let calculateTotalPrice basePrice toppingCost =
    basePrice + toppingCost
```

- `let` is used to define a function or value.
- `basePrice` and `toppingCost` are the inputs.
- `basePrice + toppingCost` is what the function returns.

### 2. **Immutable Data**

In F#, data is immutable by default. Once you create a value, it stays the same. For example:

```fsharp
let basePrice = 5.0m
```

To create a new value based on `basePrice`, you'd do:

```fsharp
let newPrice = basePrice + 1.0m
```

### 3. **Records and Discriminated Unions**

F# features like records and discriminated unions make modeling data simple.

- **Records** are straightforward data containers:

  ```fsharp
  type Burger = { Name: string; BasePrice: decimal; Toppings: string list }
  ```

  This defines a `Burger` with a name, a base price, and a list of toppings.

- **Discriminated Unions** let you define a type that can be one of several options:

  ```fsharp
  type BurgerSize =
    | Small
    | Medium
    | Large
  ```

  This defines `BurgerSize` as Small, Medium, or Large, which helps us handle different burger sizes in our simulation.

These features will help us model our food truck's data and manage various types of information effectively.

Stay tuned as we start building our food truck simulation. We'll kick things off with some background on Domain-Drive Design (DDD), the core components and then add more details as we go.

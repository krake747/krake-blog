# AOC 2024, Day 04: Ceres Search

[Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4) of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/), **Ceres Search**, challenges us with a word search on the Ceres monitoring station. In this puzzle, we're tasked with finding instances of the word "XMAS" in various directions, and later, identifying X-MAS patterns shaped as an 'X'.

<!-- more -->

## Problem Breakdown

The input consists of a grid of characters, and we need to find occurrences of the word "XMAS" both normally and in the form of an X-MAS pattern.

### **Part 1**: Word Search

For the first part, we are asked to locate every instance of the word "XMAS" in the grid. The word can appear horizontally, vertically, diagonally, or in reverse.

### **Part 2**: X-MAS Pattern

In the second part, we're looking for an X-shaped pattern where "MAS" appears in both arms of the X. Each "MAS" can appear forwards or backwards.

## Conclusion

Day 4 of Advent of Code 2024 presents a difficult challenge in pattern matching and grid traversal. 
The key to solving both parts lies in recognizing all possible directions and orientations of the word "XMAS" and "X-MAS". 
The problem is a great exercise in multi-directional searching and leveraging grid-based operations.

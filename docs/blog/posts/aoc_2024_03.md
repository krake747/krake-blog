# AOC 2024, Day 03: Mull It Over

[Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3) of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/), **Mull It Over**, is all about parsing and interpreting a simulated computer memory dump. 
This puzzle introduces conditional execution and multiplication operations, blending regex wizardry with state management.

## Problem Breakdown

The input consists of lines representing operations on a simulated memory:

1. `mul(x, y)`: Multiply x and y, and add the result to the total.
2. `do()`: Enable operations.
3. `don't()`: Disable operations.

### **Part 1**: Basic Computation

For the first part, we simply compute the total result by summing the products of all `mul(x, y)` operations.
There are no conditional statements; every operation is applied.

### **Part 2**: Conditional Execution

In the second part, the `do()` and `don't()` commands toggle whether subsequent operations are executed. 
When `do()` is called, operations resume as normal; when `don't()` is called, operations are ignored until a `do()` command appears again.

## Solutions

=== "C#"

    ```csharp
    using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
    using AdventOfCode.Lib;
    using State = (bool Enabled, long Total);

    namespace AdventOfCode.Y2024;

    [AocPuzzle(2024, 3, "Mull It Over", "C#")]
    public sealed partial class Day03 : IAocDay<long>
    {
        public static long Part1(AocInput input) =>
            input.Text.Pipe(text => ComputerMemory().Matches(text).Sum(Instructions));

        public static long Part2(AocInput input) => input.Text
            .Pipe(text => ComputerMemoryWithConditionals().Matches(text)
                .Aggregate(
                    new State(true, 0),
                    (state, m) => m.Value switch
                    {
                        "do()" => state with { Enabled = true },
                        "don't()" => state with { Enabled = false },
                        _ when state.Enabled => state with { Total = state.Total + Instructions(m) },
                        _ => state
                    }
                )
            )
            .Pipe(state => state.Total);

        private static int Instructions(Match m) =>
            int.Parse(m.Groups[1].Value) * int.Parse(m.Groups[2].Value);

        [GeneratedRegex(@"mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)", RegexOptions.Compiled | RegexOptions.NonBacktracking)]
        private static partial Regex ComputerMemory();

        [GeneratedRegex(@"do\(\)|don't\(\)|mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)", RegexOptions.Compiled | RegexOptions.NonBacktracking)]
        private static partial Regex ComputerMemoryWithConditionals();
    }
    ```

=== "F#"

    ```fsharp
    open System.Text.RegularExpressions
    open AdventOfCode.Lib

    module Fay03 =

        [<Struct>]
        type State = { Enabled: bool; Total: int64 }

        let instructions (m: Match) : int64 =
            int64 (m.Groups[1].Value) * int64 (m.Groups[2].Value)

        let conditionalInstructions (state: State) (m: Match) =
            match m.Value with
            | "do()" -> { state with Enabled = true }
            | "don't()" -> { state with Enabled = false }
            | _ when state.Enabled -> { state with Total = state.Total + instructions m }
            | _ -> state

        let part1 (input: AocInput) : int64 =
            input.Text |> Regex(@"mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)").Matches |> Seq.sumBy instructions

        let part2 (input: AocInput) : int64 =
            input.Text
            |> Regex(@"do\(\)|don't\(\)|mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)").Matches
            |> Seq.fold conditionalInstructions { Enabled = true; Total = 0 }
            |> _.Total
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```py
    from aoc.core import AocInput
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from functools import reduce
    from typing import Match
    import re


    @dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
    class State:
        enabled: bool
        total: int


    def instructions(m: Match) -> int:
        return int(m.groups()[0]) * int(m.groups()[1])


    def conditional_instructions(state: State, m: Match) -> State:
        match m.group(0):
            case "do()":
                return State(True, state.total)
            case "don't()":
                return State(False, state.total)
            case _ if state.enabled:
                return State(state.enabled, state.total + instructions(m))
            case _:
                return state


    def part1(input: AocInput) -> int:
        return sum(instructions(m) for m in re.finditer(r"mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)", input.text))


    def part2(input: AocInput) -> int:
        state = reduce(
            conditional_instructions,
            [m for m in re.finditer(r"do\(\)|don't\(\)|mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)", input.text)],
            State(True, 0),
        )
        return state.total
    ``` 

## Conclusion 

Day 3 of Advent of Code 2024 introduced a fun mix of parsing, conditional logic, and basic arithmetic. 
The challenge lay in correctly interpreting the state changes introduced by `do()` and `don't()` commands while processing the input.

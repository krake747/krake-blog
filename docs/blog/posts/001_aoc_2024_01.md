# AOC 2024, Day 01: Tackling Historian Hysteria

Advent of Code 2024 is here, and as always, it starts with a simpler challenge: Historian Hysteria. In this post, I'll provide solutions in both C# and F#, showcasing the beauty of solving problems in multiple languages.

## Problem Breakdown

In Day 1 of Advent of Code 2024, you are given two lists of location IDs. The goal is to:

1. Find the total distance between the two lists after sorting and comparing corresponding pairs.
2. Calculate a similarity score based on how often each number in the first list appears in the second.

### **Part 1**: Distance Between Sorted Lists

To solve Part 1, we need to:

- Sort both lists.
- Compare each corresponding pair of numbers.
- Sum the absolute differences between the pairs.

### **Part 2**: Calculating the Similarity Score

For Part 2, we calculate a similarity score by:

- Adding up each number from the left list.
- Multiplying each number by how many times it appears in the right list.

## C\#

```csharp
using AdventOfCode.Lib;

namespace AdventOfCode.Y2024;
[AocPuzzle(2024, 1, "Historian Hysteria", "C#")]
public sealed class Day01 : IAocDay<int>
{
    public static int Part1(AocInput input) => input.AllLines
        .Pipe(lines =>
        {
            var left = Instructions(lines, 0);
            var right = Instructions(lines, 1);
            return left.Zip(right, (l, r) => Math.Abs(l - r)).Sum();
        });

    public static int Part2(AocInput input) => input.AllLines
        .Pipe(lines =>
        {
            var left = Instructions(lines, 0);
            var counts = Instructions(lines, 1).CountBy(i => i).ToDictionary();
            return left.Sum(id => counts.GetValueOrDefault(id) * id);
        });
    
    private static IEnumerable<int> Instructions(IEnumerable<string> lines, int col) =>
        from line in lines
        let nums = line.Split("   ").Select(int.Parse).ToArray()
        orderby nums[col]
        select nums[col];
}
```

## F\#

```fsharp
open AdventOfCode.Lib

module Fay01 =

    let instructions (lines: string seq) (col: int) =
        lines
        |> Seq.map (fun line -> line.Split("   ") |> Array.map int)
        |> Seq.sortBy (fun nums -> nums[col])
        |> Seq.map (fun nums -> nums[col])

    let part1 (input: AocInput) =
        let column = instructions input.Lines
        let left = column 0
        let right = column 1

        Seq.zip left right |> Seq.map (fun x -> abs (fst x - snd x)) |> Seq.sum

    let part2 (input: AocInput) =
        let column = instructions input.Lines
        let left = column 0
        let counts = column 1 |> Seq.countBy id |> Map.ofSeq

        let getCount id =
            Map.tryFind id counts |> Option.defaultValue 0

        left |> Seq.sumBy (fun id -> getCount id * id)
```

## Conclusion 

Day 1 of Advent of Code 2024 introduced an interesting puzzle, involving sorting and comparing lists of historical location IDs. Whether in C\# or F\#, both solutions tackled the task efficiently, demonstrating the power of functional programming and LINQ for problem-solving.

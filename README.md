# krake-blog

I was generally curious about static site generators. I thought why not give it a go and create a simple blog.
I am using Material for MkDocs instead of creating my own site, because of its many features and community support.
In addition, Material for MkDocs is easy to setup and deploy to GitHub Pages.

Now whether I will actually produce blog content remains to be seen.

You can visit the blog on [krake-blog](https://krake747.github.io/krake-blog/)

## Quick start

```bash
py -m venv .venv
pip install mkdocs-material
```
